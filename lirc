Creating one is fairly straightforward using

/usr/bin/irrecord

which guides users along the needed process.

If using a detected remote, invoke it like so:

$ irrecord --device=/dev/lirc0 beebox

The program will instruct users to begin hitting keys on the remote in an attempt to learn it,
ultimately mapping out every button and its corresponding scancode.
The process should take no more than 10 minutes.

When finished, save the resulting file to /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/foo.conf and proceed

irrecord -  application for recording IR-codes for usage with lirc
Copyright (C) 1998,1999 Christoph Bartelmus(lirc@bartelmus.de)

This program will record the signals from your remote control
and create a config file for lircd.

A proper config file for lircd is maybe the most vital part of this
package, so you should invest some time to create a working config
file. Although I put a good deal of effort in this program it is often
not possible to automatically recognize all features of a remote
control. Often short-comings of the receiver hardware make it nearly
impossible. If you have problems to create a config file READ THE
DOCUMENTATION at https://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki

If there already is a remote control of the same brand available at
http://sf.net/p/lirc-remotes you might want to try using such a
remote as a template. The config files already contains all
parameters of the protocol used by remotes of a certain brand and
knowing these parameters makes the job of this program much
easier. There are also template files for the most common protocols
available. Templates can be downloaded using irdb-get(1). You use a
template file by providing the path of the file as a command line
parameter.

Please take the time to finish the file as described in
https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc-remotes/wiki/Checklist/ an send it
to  <lirc@bartelmus.de> so it can be made available to others.

Checking for ambient light  creating too much disturbances.
Please don't press any buttons, just wait a few seconds...

No significant noise (received 0 bytes)

Enter name of remote (only ascii, no spaces) :fooo

----------

Using fooo.lircd.conf as output filename

Now start pressing buttons on your remote control.

It is very important that you press many different buttons and hold them
down for approximately one second. Each button should generate at least one
dot but in no case more than ten dots of output.
Don't stop pressing buttons until two lines of dots (2x80) have been
generated.

Press RETURN now to start recording

### lircd.service
### =================================================================


Start lircd.service and enable it to run at boot time/shutdown (recommended).

Test the remote using /usr/bin/irw, which simply echos anything received by LIRC when users push buttons on the remote to stdout.

$ irw
