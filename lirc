Creating one is fairly straightforward using

/usr/bin/irrecord

which guides users along the needed process.

If using a detected remote, invoke it like so:

$ irrecord --device=/dev/lirc0 beebox

The program will instruct users to begin hitting keys on the remote in an attempt to learn it,
ultimately mapping out every button and its corresponding scancode.
The process should take no more than 10 minutes.

When finished, save the resulting file to /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d/foo.conf and proceed



Start lircd.service and enable it to run at boot time/shutdown (recommended).

Test the remote using /usr/bin/irw, which simply echos anything received by LIRC when users push buttons on the remote to stdout.

$ irw
